# System State Snapshot — 2026-07-31

Durable record of the system's verified state after Steps 1-2 of the
SELL-suppression + data-venue unification build. A future session should
start from this ground truth, not re-derive it.

---

## 1. Unified Data Venue (Step 2 — the highest-value change)

**Before:** live generation's OHLC history (`highHistory`/`lowHistory`/`barCloseHistory` → `calculateRealATR()` → SL/TP sizing, session highs/lows, pivots, breakout detection) was sourced via REST from the **GC=F/TwelveData** chain (`fetchHistoricalData` → backend `goldPrice.getHistoricalData` route). This carried a confirmed **~$59 median basis (579 pips)** vs the Vantage `gold_m1_bars` used for audit/resolution/S-R zones. TwelveData's free-tier quota (800 credits/day) exhausted after ~13.3 hours, causing fallback to Yahoo **GC=F futures** for ~44% of trading hours — during which every trade's SL/TP was sized on a price ~590 pips from the bars that later audited its outcome.

**After (verified):** `fetchHistoricalData` (`expo/lib/trpc.ts`) now queries `gold_m1_bars` (Vantage MT5 / Exness XAUUSDm) from Supabase as the **PRIMARY** source. Generation and audit now share one spot-accurate, quota-free venue. The existing GC=F/TwelveData backend chain is preserved as a **fallback** for when Supabase is unreachable or has a stale/missing bar gap.

**Verified by** `expo/scripts/verifyBasisClosed.ts`:
- `fetchHistoricalData` returns bars tagged `vantage-mt5-supabase` (PRIMARY confirmed)
- Matched-minute basis vs audit venue (gold_m1_bars direct): **$0.0000 median, $0.0000 max** (n=119)
- Before-measurement: `expo/scripts/analyzeTwelveDataFallback.ts` — Pair 1 (TwelveData vs Vantage) $0.54 median; Pair 2 (GC=F vs Vantage) $57.93 median (n=108); fallback fires ~44% of day

**Stale-bar guard (Step 2c):** if the newest `gold_m1_bars` row is older than 5 minutes relative to `toTime`, the Supabase primary returns empty so the caller falls through to the GC=F/TwelveData fallback chain — stale bars are NEVER silently served as current. Threshold: `STALE_BAR_THRESHOLD_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000`.

**Array-alignment integrity:** the ATR array-misalignment fix (prior session) still passes — `expo/scripts/verify_item3_atr_array_misalignment.ts` 5/5 assertions green. `calculateRealATR` reads `prevClose` from `barCloseHistory` (bar-aligned), not `priceHistory` (tick-cadence).

**72h simulation:** before/after repoint both produce 13 BUY / 0 SELL (shorts suppressed). Signal count/timing unchanged in the sim because the sim harness uses synthetic sandbox bars that override `fetchHistoricalData` — it does NOT exercise the new Supabase primary. The real proof is the `verifyBasisClosed.ts` trace above. The repoint only affects the live app path, where the basis is confirmed $0.

**Telegram format:** untouched (`expo/services/telegramNotifier.ts` last modified before this build; no diff).

## 2. SELL Suppression (Step 1 — `allowShortSignals`)

**Decision basis:** six read-only counterfactuals (retest-wait, zone-SL, fixed-120-SL, SELL-side filters, SELL entry-shift 70-pip, SELL entry-shift 45-pip). BUY consistently strong (EV +0.19R covered / +0.695R full sample); SELL structurally marginal (+0.033R covered). No tested treatment made retained SELLs genuinely profitable. Suppressing SELL entirely produced the highest whole-system EV (+0.1883R vs +0.0806R baseline).

**Implementation:**
- `allowShortSignals: boolean` (default **FALSE**) added to `Settings` — a toggle, not hardcoded removal. Gold's long bias is structural today but could change; flippable back on without a code change via Settings.
- Suppression at the **emission layer** (`signalEngine.ts:6450`), AFTER geometry is computed, BEFORE internal state mutations. The engine still fully scores and geometry-computes every qualifying SELL; when suppressed it returns `null` and does NOT mutate `lastSignalType`, `lastSignalTime`, `lastSellSignalTime`, `cooldown`, `active-signal lock`, or `signalsGeneratedCount`.
- BUY emission path is **byte-unchanged** — the suppression check only fires when `analysis.signalType === 'SELL'`.
- Zero executor changes: the MT5 Telegram executor simply receives fewer signals (zero SELLs).

**Shadow logging (durable):** suppressed SELLs are pushed to `shadow_signals_v1` Supabase table via the `shadow.push` tRPC route (`expo/services/shadowSignalService.ts` → `expo/backend/trpc/routes/shadowSignals.ts`). Service-role writes, RLS SELECT-only for anon/authenticated. The shadow record captures the full would-be geometry PLUS the +40pip entry-shift variant (77% fill rate in counterfactual) so every tested SELL alternative stays monitorable against real forward data. Tagged `SHADOW_SELL_SUPPRESSED` for filtering in diagnostics export.

**Verified by:**
- `expo/scripts/verifyShadowPushHandler.ts` — shadow.push handler code path round-trip: insert + readback + RLS all confirmed (real row pasted in build report).
- `expo/scripts/runShadowMigration.ts` — table exists, service-role insert/readback works, anon insert blocked by RLS.
- `expo/scripts/test_sell_suppression.ts` — 4 deterministic tests, 26 assertions, all PASS: suppressed SELL returns null + no state mutation; allowed SELL emits + mutates state; BUY unaffected by toggle; BUY emits immediately after suppressed SELL (no cooldown consumed).
- 72h sim: shorts-suppressed = 13 BUY / 0 SELL; shorts-allowed = 12 BUY / 17 SELL (BUY count 12→13 is the expected consequence — suppressed SELLs free active-signal slots for BUYs; Test 4 proves this mechanism directly).
- Regression suite: `runChecks` green.

**KNOWN ISSUE — backend deployment:** the live backend bundle (`EXPO_PUBLIC_RORK_FUNCTIONS_URL`) currently returns **"no bundle deployed for this project" (HTTP 503)** for ALL routes — `shadow.push`, `goldPrice.getHistoricalData`, root. This is a deployment-state issue, not a shadow-route bug. The `shadow_signals_v1` table itself works (service-role insert + readback + RLS proven), and the `shadow.push` handler code path is correct (handler round-trip proven in-process). Once the backend bundle is redeployed, `pushShadowSellRecord` will land rows via the real HTTP path. Until then, the engine's `pushShadowSellRecord` fire-and-forget call will log a 503 warning but will NOT block, delay, or alter live signal generation.

## 3. Open Finding — Drift-Veto-on-BUY (NEXT optimization candidate, deliberately deferred)

**Finding (from prior session, `expo/scripts/analyzeDriftVetoOnBuy.ts`):** the Phase 2 counter-trend drift veto IS over-firing on BUYs. It dropped **4/50** counter-trend BUYs that had **positive EV (+0.2295R, 75% win rate)**. Three of the four were winners (+1.149R, +0.385R, +0.385R). The veto is costing the long book **$3.8 in net $** and **+0.0036R in EV per signal**. The veto threshold (2.0×ATR) may be too low for BUYs, or the counter-trend classification may be too broad.

**Why this matters now:** longs are the entire system (SELLs suppressed). A veto that drops winning longs directly costs the only book that's running.

**Status: NOT actioned. Deliberately deferred.** This was investigated read-only and logged. No engine change was made. The current samples predate the Step 2 data-venue fix, so acting on this now would be optimizing against a baseline measured on the wrong venue. The recommended sequence is: let the corrected engine run → gather real forward data → re-evaluate the drift veto against the new baseline before any fix.

---

## 4. Recommended Next Action

**LET THE SYSTEM RUN and gather real forward data from the corrected engine before any further optimization.** The current samples (six counterfactuals, Phase 1 audit, drift-veto analysis) all predate the Step 2 data-venue unification. Every conclusion in this build is sound on its own measured data, but the forward data from the corrected engine is the only data that reflects the system as it now genuinely stands. Acting on further optimization now — drift-veto fix, new geometry variants, new filters — would be optimizing against a baseline that no longer exists.

Specifically:
1. **Redeploy the backend bundle** so `shadow.push` and `goldPrice.getHistoricalData` HTTP paths work live (the 503 affects all routes, not just shadow).
2. **Run forward for at least 2-3 weeks** on the corrected engine (gold_m1_bars as primary OHLC + SELL suppressed).
3. **Re-export diagnostics** and re-run the drift-veto-on-BUY analysis against the new forward data before deciding whether to adjust the veto threshold.
4. **Monitor `shadow_signals_v1`** to confirm suppression is still the right call — if a future regime shift toward gold weakness is detected (shadow SELLs start showing positive EV against real bars), flip `allowShortSignals` back on.
